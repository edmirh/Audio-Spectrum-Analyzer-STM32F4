<h3>Audio Spectrum Analyzer STM32F4<h3>
<p>The idea is to do a Fourier transform of the input signal. The input signal can be <i>sin</i>, <i> square </i>, <i> triangle </i> or any other signal with arbitrary frequency. In this case, the Android application "Frequency Generator" was used, which generates a sinusoidal signal at the desired frequency <i>(1Hz-8kHz)</i>, the signal is transmitted via the speakers of the mobile device. A microphone was used as an input to the system, ie the output signal from the mobile phone speakers is detected by the microphone located on the <b>STM32F407VGT6</b> development board. The signal detected by the microphone must be modulated by PDM modulation, ie translated into digital form for further processing. Since this is an input signal that is <i> sin </i>, it is necessary to do PCM modulation so that the input signal <i> x (t) = sin (2 \ pi ft) </i> can be properly reconstructed and displayed in <i> Python </i>. The modulated PCM signal or signal samples are transmitted via UART. The data from the UART goes directly to Python using the <i> Serial () </i> function, based on the obtained data, the signal processing or Fourier transform is performed. The spectrum of the input signal was obtained at the output of the system.</p>
